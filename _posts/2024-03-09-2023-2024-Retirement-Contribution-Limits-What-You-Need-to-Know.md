Hey there, folks! Can you believe how fast 2024 is zooming by? Seems like just yesterday we were ringing in the new year. Anyhow, remember that handy reference I whipped up last year for max contribution amounts? Well, it turns out many of you found it pretty darn useful, so here I am again, serving up the 2023/2024 max retirement contribution amounts in one neat little package.  

**Quick Heads Up:** Before we dive in, gotta throw out the disclaimer — I'm not a financial whiz, just a regular Joe sharing some info on the web. So, as always, do your own double-checking or chat with a financial advisor who's got your back.

### Wrap-Up Thoughts  
So, for the grand finale: In **2023**, the max retirement contribution for IRA, HSA (Self), and 401(k) summed up to **\$32,850**. That's about **\$1,368.75** per paycheck if you're getting paid twice a month or roughly **\$1,263.46** bi-weekly.

In **2024**, that number bumped up to **\$34,150**. Meaning, you're looking at around **\$1,422.92** per paycheck semi-monthly or approximately **\$1,313.46** bi-weekly.
