At the beginning of the 2023 year, life took a massive, unexpected change of course for me. In essence, I was 
reminded once again that fate is fickle. With that said, a lifestyle change can greatly transform your perspective. 
The conversion from car commute to a bike commute drastically improved my life. So, if you ended up on this post 
because you are asking yourself whether you should buy a bike and switch your transportation methods, then my
answer is a resounding **yes**! 

## Because, reasons  
I am not a cyclist. At the start of this expedition, I didn't have an overwhelming love for biking. To be honest, I cannot 
conclude that I have an extensive love for biking even today. With that said, commuting is different beast. Just as performing errands 
via your car does not embody the love of driving, biking may not inspire the love of cycling. Nonetheless, biking is awesome.  

As a bike commuter, my life unequivocally changed for the better.  

The obvious first pro is money savings. I no longer have to spend money on gas, oil changes, tires, and all the other non-stop vehicle maintenance costs. 
Since the wear and tear on my car was no longer occurring, the reduction in all costs was shocking. Also, while I can park for free at work, 
you may see massive savings in this category. If you choose a bike commute, your wallet will thank you.  

Next, I am less stressed. Yep, turns out getting movement immediately in the beginning of the day 
and at the end of the day is great for stress management. Beyond this, I enjoy being outside. Vitamin D baby is a good thing! If you would like to be 
a happier person, then choose the bike commute.  

Third, trip planning (or lack thereof) allowed me to be more social. My morning ride in to work consists of speed and enjoyment of the morning sunrise. 
The afternoon ride is a bit different. I visit parks (to set up my hammock), find new shops (I love a good malt), and visit friends (hey, you have to coordinate if biking). 
The two wheels made me a community member.  

Last, the benefit of health is substantial. Motion is critical to my daily life. As an Individual that has chosen IT as a career, I spend a LOT of time in front of a 
computer screen. Before I chose the bike commute, I was not active enough. Even worse, I didn't even realize how little I was moving. My cardiovascular system gets a 
minimum of one hour of work when I bike commute. Future me is saying thank you.  

### Signing off  
I hope this encourages you to purchase that bike that you have had your eye on. Likewise, I hope bike commuting has the same impact for you as it did for me. Please share 
your experience below in the comments as I would love to hear them. As for my bike, I got the [Ride1Up Roadster v2 (Gravel Edition)](https://ride1up.com/product/roadster-v2/). Love it.  

As someone that lives in the Midwest I see winter fast encroaching. I am not sure if I will continue to commute via bike in the Winter. With that said, bike commuting was such a 
positive experience that I may just give a try.  

Anyway, I better get back to reviewing my PowerShell code.  Happy biking!
