title: Making blogging simple!

{% include _toc.html %}

Creating a website, managing posts, and formating text all describe items that I do not wish to spend my limited time, effort, and energy. Instead, I desire an easy, simple, and intuitive blogging system. Thankfully, I stumbled upon this [blog post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Following the step-by-step guide created by [Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/barryclark/?rel=author "Barry Clark"), I had my blog post up in a matter of minutes! Yes, you heard me correctly - minutes. 

However, the original theme did not fit my style. So a quick fork of the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/ "Minimal Mistakes"), a quick read of the [Quick-Start guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/), and a can-do attitude is all it took to get this first post finished. 

With my new found goal of creating more "public" facing scripts, I am exciting to have my writing space and script authoring location to be on the same platform. 

At this time, I can only think of a couple drawbacks of this system. That is, just like my scripts, all my my quick to publish writing skills will be caught in commits (you know, if anyone desires to take a look). Also, as I dive deeper in this new publishing method, I will desire to modify the site more and more to unmanageable state. In the end, all the drawbacks are just a part of the learning process. 

So, welcome to my blog, I'm happy you are here!
