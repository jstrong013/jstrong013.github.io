Once again, I am sitting at my desk tonight looking up the max contribution amounts to various types 
of retirement accounts. As such, I decided to make a post here that I can bookmark. I hope to stop Googling this information over and over again. 
In time, I shall see if my idea actually saved me time.  

**Before You Continue:** I am not a financial professional. That is to say, I am an individual on the Internet. When it comes to the knowledge below, be 
sure to verify with your own research or consult with a fiduciary financial advisor.

### Final Thoughts  
The max retirement contribution amount for IRA, HSA (Self), and 401(k) for **2022** is **\$30,150**.  
That is **\$1,256.25** per paycheck if semi-monthly or about **\$1,159.61** for bi-weekly. 

The max retirement contribution amount for IRA, HSA (Self), and 401(k) for **2023** is **\$32,850**.  
Or **\$1,368.57** per paycheck if semi-monthly or about **\$1,263.46** for bi-weekly.

I see every dollar as buying financial freedom. So, my friend, I believe you should
live life in the moment while saving like you will be alive tomorrow.  

Thus far in my limited investing life, I have found investments in tax advantaged accounts 
in broad based index funds to be life changing. I wish you luck in your financial future!
