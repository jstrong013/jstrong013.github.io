excerpt: "Replying to a specific message in Teams desktop is now on the Microsoft roadmap! While the feature is in development, here is a 
workaround to reply to a specific message in the Teams desktop application."

This feature exists in the iOS and Android Teams applications today. To my dismay and shock, the reply feature is not available in the Microsoft Teams Desktop app. 
At least not now.  

To my surprise, Microsoft has added it to their [roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=81113) with an anticipated 
release date of CY April 2021! 

In the meantime, my workaround has been to quote the conversation and add my response beneath it.  

This manual process works as follows:  
1. Copy the text of the previous reply 
2. Navigate to the "Type a new Message" box or select Reply... 
3. On your keyboard, select the Shift Key + '>' to make the quote box  
4. Next, Ctrl + V to paste the content from step 1  
5. Press enter twice to escape the quoted content   
6. Type your response 
7. Hit the send button to make your quoted reply! 

While the manual process works, I will be super excited to see Microsoft release the feature!
