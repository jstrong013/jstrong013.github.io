 **Question: Do you need a license for Servers for windows Defender for Endpoint?**
## Answer: Yes  
A license is required for Windows Defender for Endpoint for each onboarded Windows Server.  
The cost, at this moment, is $15/month per server. 
In order to license your server, you must have the following licenses: 
 > Windows E5/A5, Microsoft 365 E5/A5 or Microsoft 365 E5 Security subscription licenses. 

With that said, if you are using Azure Security Center features then you likely have already onboarded the server in Microsoft Defender. 
In turn, this may mean you are duplicating licensing costs. So, if using Azure Security Center then you likely do not need 
to purchase a license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as you have purchased it via this method.

### Final Notes  
I am not a Microsoft licensing specialist. Beyond this, the Microsoft licensing model appears to constantly 
be updated. As such, I highly recommend reaching out to a Microsoft licensing specialist or a 
reseller to confirm the above statements.
