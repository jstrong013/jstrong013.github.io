This post is specific to a CaseWare Working Papers **Cloud** sync file. For a CaseWare Working Papers file, use this [post](https://www.caseware.com/us/case-knowledge/restore-deleted-files-windows-recycle-bin).

When you delete a file from the document manager in a CaseWare Working Papers Cloud sync engagement, it is placed in the Windows Recycle Bin.  

You can restore the deleted document by:
1. Right-Click the Recycle Bin on the desktop and choose open
2. Find the document you wish to restore
3. Drag and drop the document back into the document manager

**Info** If you clicked **Restore the selected items** in the Windows Recycle bin menu 
rather than drag and drop, then the file is likely located
at C:\Users\\*username*\AppData\Local\Temp {: .notice--info}
