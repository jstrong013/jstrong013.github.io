I love Azure. I'm able to build, test, and dismantle infrastructure environments in a few hours. With that said, 
I remember thinking "where the heck do I start for this thing called Azure?" A simple Google search yields a plethora of results!

In this post, I wanted to keep things simple with a list of resources for the beginner.
Of course, your background in technology, knowledge, and experience will
determine the resources you need to be successful in learning Azure.
The education materials below are geared to help you pass the AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals exam).


# Getting Started (Passing the AZ-900)  
I suggest the following tools and resources to pass the Azure Fundamentals exam and to begin your Azure journey:

1. Visit the Microsoft Certification page for Azure Fundamentals: [Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900).
2. Do all of the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) modules (especially if you have limited or no background in IT). The learning modules for Azure Fundamentals are located at the bottom of the page in the above step (step 1).  
3. Create an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). Be ready to
hit the books as you get $200 free credit for the first 30 days (at the time of this post).  
4. Learn from John Savill by watching all the videos in his most up-to-date [Azure Fundamentals Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nED0_vMEniWBQjSoxTsBYS3). As
you watch his content, follow along in the portal for hands on experience.  
5. Now, take a moment to review and study your notes. Next, do the [sample exam questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/resources/az-900-sample-questions) from Microsoft to test your knowledge and evaluate your readiness.  
6. Attend the [Azure Virtual Training Day: Fundamentals](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trainingdays/azure) class. If you attend this course, you get a FREE voucher to take the AZ-900 exam.

By this stage, I'm confident in your knowledge of the basics of the Azure environment. If you choose to take the Azure Fundamentals exam, I strongly believe you will pass.

## Hungry for Learning
The above will give you a solid overview. However, if you are like me, then it is not enough. I am a hands on, self-paced learner.
If you resonate with this approach, then here are a few additional education materials.  

* Buy this book (or obtain for FREE in digital format) - [Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/learn-azure-in-a-month-of-lunches/)
* Do [The Cloud Resume Challenge - Azure](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/)
* Checkout [Microsoft Cloud Skills Challenge: 30 Days to Learn It](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/30-days-to-learn-it) and do any Azure related challenge.  
* Do the following [labs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-900T0x-MicrosoftAzureFundamentals/)

### Additional Resources  
If you did not feel confident with the sample exam questions (step 5 of the Getting Started section), then here are a couple of items that may be of help:  
* Anki flashcards from michele0dorigatti@gmail.com: [Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2049948283). The [Anki program](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is amazing!  
* Pay for [Whizlabs practice exams](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-900/) to help you ace your attempt at the official exam.

Well folks, that's all I have for your introduction to Azure Fundamental exam.
My aim was to strike the balance of enough resources to be achieve success and understanding while not being overwhelming in the content provided.
How did I do? Feel free to comment below with your favorite learning materials and your Azure journey experience.

Until next time friends,
