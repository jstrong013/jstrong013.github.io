You love technology. On your day-to-day duties, you write knowledgebase articles. You solve technology problems. You are a savant with a computer. If you are looking to further grow as an IT professional then these books are my go-to, must reads.

1. [Time Management for Systems Administrators](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007836.do)  
Are you feeling overwhelmed? Have a plethora of responsibilities? You need to order
this book today! The book, while dated, is a big credit to how I do my large volume of projects. I remain on task with the ability to focus on a long list of daily, weekly, and monthly assignments due to this book.
2. [Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition)  
Do you work in a Windows environment? If yes, then PowerShell is an unquestionable
tool that has to be a part of your tool set. PowerShell allows you to configure any windows systems with ease. It allows automation of repetitive tasks. Scripting helps you learn in-depth the systems you mange. Once you complete this book, a bonus book to read is [Learn PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-toolmaking-in-a-month-of-lunches).  
3. [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/)  
This is a book on business and leadership. The big takeaway is how IT is a
member of every business unit (or should be). In the end, it helped me
transition my thoughts to think with the larger picture in my head. That is,
keep the entire business workflow in the forefront
of my mind.

As a post-collegiate, avid reader, my goal was not to provide a long list of
every book I have read. Google exists for that reason. The simple list of books
provided me the most growth as an IT professional. If you read these books today,
you will experience your professional value grow.
