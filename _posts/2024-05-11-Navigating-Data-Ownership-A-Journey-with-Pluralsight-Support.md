excerpt: "A seemingly innocuous change to my email address on Pluralsight led to a significant shift in data ownership rights."

In today's digital landscape, understanding data ownership is paramount, even when it comes to platforms like Pluralsight. 
If you're considering a switch from an individual to a business plan, it's crucial to know that this move entails transferring data ownership to the business entity. 
Surprisingly, this transition occurs without any prior warnings or notifications.

As a Pluralsight learner, I was taken aback when a simple change of my primary email address to my business one resulted in such a significant alteration of data ownership rights. 
What's more, reversing this change isn't straightforward and requires the involvement of business plan administrators.  

While I'm fortunate to have responsive and supportive administrators, I couldn't help but wonder if others might encounter similar surprises. 
It raised questions about whether this process was intentionally designed by the Pluralsight team.  

## Reaching Out to Support  
Seeking clarity, I reached out to Pluralsight support.  

After some correspondence, I articulated my concerns regarding the account management process, particularly regarding email modifications and their implications on data ownership.  

> "Hi *redacted*, <br><br>I am aiming to seek clarification regarding the account management design strategy at Pluralsight, specifically concerning the process of email modification and its implications on data ownership. <br> <br>It is my understanding that the current design allows a user to initially register a personal subscription using their personal email. The user can then add a business email as a secondary address and subsequently designate this business email as the primary one, relegating the initial personal email to secondary status. I have observed that during this switch, there are no user interface notifications or warnings indicating that the personal account data will be converted to a business plan, thereby transferring data ownership to the organization. <br><br>Could you please confirm if this is indeed the intended functionality? Furthermore, it appears that the only way to revert the personal profile back from a business plan is for the organization to release the user from the plan, effectively giving the organization ownership of the data without explicit consent from the user on their original personal account. <br> <br>I am keen on ensuring accurate representation of Pluralsightâ€™s policies and account management design. I appreciate your confirmation on whether this is the expected system behavior. <br> <br>Thank you for your attention to this inquiry."

In response, a Senior Product Support Representative acknowledged the oversight, emphasizing Pluralsight's commitment to data protection. They admitted that there should have been clear notifications during the transition process and assured me that they would investigate the matter further.  

> "Hi Jeremiah, <br> <br>Thank you for your patience. <br> <br>We received a response which you can read below: <br><br>
    > Hi Jeremiah, <br> <br>Thank you for getting in touch with us.. Pluralsight takes data protection seriously and agrees that there should have been notifications or warnings indicating that personal account data would be converted to a business plan. When you added the company profile to your personal account, the intended direction was for you to transfer data controllership to your plan admin. In compliance with data privacy laws, we would not only require you to transfer controllership to the business but also for the business to accept icontrollership. We apologize for any inconvenience and will thoroughly investigate this situation. In the meantime, we would appreciate it if you could request the change through your admin. If that is not possible we will collaborate with your admin to update your email address.<br>
> Any questions, do let us know." 

### Reflections  
I appreciated Pluralsight's transparent response to my inquiry. In an era where many companies evade such concerns until escalated to social media, their approach deserves recognition.  
While my issue was satisfactorily addressed, I'm unsure if it will lead to any changes in Pluralsight's design. 
Nonetheless, I've made my opinion known on the matter.  

This experience serves as a reminder to remain vigilant about data ownership and the implications of account modifications. 
It underscores the importance of understanding who controls our data and where it's shared.  

Here's to continued digital learning and staying informed. Wishing you all a fantastic day ahead!
