### Paycheck Math Time
Let's crunch a few numbers because, hey, math is cheaper than therapy.

**2024 Total:** **\$34,150** for your IRA, HSA (Self), and 401(k)
 * About **\$1,422.92** per paycheck if you're getting paid twice a month 
 * About **\$1,313.46** per paycheck if you're paid every two weeks

**2025 Total:** **\$34,800** for your IRA, HSA (Self), and 401(k)
 * **\$1,450** semi-monthly 
 * About **\$1,338.46** bi-weekly

Saving for your future is important — *very* important. 
But don't forget the true treasures in life: your time, your passions, your health, your family, and, of course, the perfect cup of coffee on a lazy Sunday morning.  

Invest wisely, live fully.
