This is a personal blog about sharing the creation of solutions, thoughts, and other random musings.
The representation of these views are mine and may not be attributed to any company, individual,
or entity that is not me. As is true with most technology, scripting, and documentation, I
find assistance from the community. I always attempt to attribute these findings within the blog post.
With that said, even by sourcing these vendors, users, or entities, they are not
to be considered to be associated to these posts in any representation anywhere in this site unless
explicitly listed as an author or contributor.  Furthermore, my view points do change over time as I
continue to grow and learn. I may no longer agree with my own ideas but may retain posts as historical archive.  

The information on this site is given for technical education only. It may not work for
your specific situation. It is not professional advice. All scripts, steps, or materials are
provided as-is and are considered untested. As such, be sure to validate all information used from this site
in a development environment as any type of damage or downtime to your infrastructure is your responsibility. I highly recommend hiring a professional,
reviewing vendor documentation, and reaching out to vendor support to validate the information contained within
this blog.  

Finally, the views expressed on this site are mine and not those of my employer (past or present).  

## Why the addition of this page?  
I came across [Matt Cutts discalimer](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/disclaimer/) and thought I should
add a disclaimer to my website!  

As Mr. Cutts worded so eloquently:  
> Just in case. If I say something stupid in the future [or have in the past], it’s better to be able to point out that the stupidity is mine, and mine alone. My stupidity! You can’t have it!  

---<cite> Matt Cutts </cite>

I believe in ownership of my mistakes. If I ever should make a mistake, I am the responsible party.  
Period. Full Stop.  

### No longer wish to be attributed?  
If I have referenced your public blog, scripts, or other public community material and you no longer wish
to be attributed or wish to have the content removed, please let me know.  I can appreciate that you may no
longer wish to be referenced and will remediate as soon as possible. Furthermore, if you would like me to modify or better
emphasize your work, please let me know. Basically, I want you to get the credit you deserve in the format you desire!  

While I am not a lawyer, I do try to absolute best to follow fair use copyright law, the spirit of your blog (e.g. your disclaimer), and the community forum's
website copyright law.  With that in mind, even if you have shared a piece of work under Public Domain but you later decide that you no longer
wish to share this information, I am open to removing the content even if the copyright allows me to have the content.  

In essence, I'm trying to say that if I have happened to use your creative ideas, code snippets, or referenced information,
I did it in manner that I hope you appreciate. If you have changed your mind or really any reason, I am happy to remove or modify to
get us to that state.  

On an aside, I would highly encourage you to PLEASE, pretty please, [include a license](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) in your public repository. As I continue to
learn about copyright law, it is a highly welcome addition to any hobby code projects.  

To date, I have received the following requests to modify, adapt, or fix attributions:  
* None  

I will update this page accordingly for any requests that may come.  

**Question**: Why did you include this section?  
**Answer**: No weird intentions meant by this section. I simply believe in transparency. If I made
a mistake, I want the readers to know that I correct them. Above is a list of my corrections for transparency.    

#### Thank You  
I probably should have included this page sooner. I am happy to be a contributor to the community that
I have so heavily relied on over the years.  
I have read, referenced, and viewed thousands of posts in community forums, websites, and blogs to solve many
technical issues and errors.
I now have the knowledge and understanding of the work that goes into these posts. Due to this background, I want
to simply say thanks.
