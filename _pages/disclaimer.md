Welcome to my personal blog, where I share my journey in crafting solutions, articulating thoughts, and indulging in occasional random musings. 
The opinions and views expressed here are solely mine and should not be associated with any companies, individuals, or entities that are not explicitly mentioned as such.

As an enthusiastic member of the technology and scripting community, I often find inspiration and assistance from fellow enthusiasts. 
I make it a point to credit these contributions within the respective blog posts.
However, the mere mention of these sources does not imply their endorsement of or affiliation with the content presented here unless they are explicitly recognized as an author or contributor.  

It's worth noting that my viewpoints are subject to evolve as I continue to learn and grow.
Consequently, I may not always agree with my past opinions, but I choose to keep these posts as a historical archive.  

The information provided on this site is intended for technical education purposes only. 
It is not meant to serve as professional advice. All scripts, steps, or procedures are provided "as is," without any guarantees of efficacy, and are considered untested. 
Thus, it is crucial to verify any information from this site in a controlled environment, as any resulting damage or downtime to your infrastructure remains your responsibility. 
I strongly recommend consulting a professional, reviewing vendor documentation, or contacting vendor support for validation before applying any information obtained from this blog.

The views expressed here are personal and do not reflect those of any past or present employer.

## Why the addition of this page?  
Inspired by [Matt Cutts discalimer](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/disclaimer/), I felt it prudent to include a similar statement on my site.

As Matt Cutts eloquently put it:  
> Just in case. If I say something stupid in the future [or have in the past], it’s better to be able to point out that the stupidity is mine, and mine alone. My stupidity! You can’t have it!

I fully embrace the responsibility for my mistakes. When errors occur, they are mine alone to own.
