Hi, [Boozhoo](https://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu/main-entry/boozhoo-pc-interj), and welcome to my corner of the digital world. 
I'm Jeremiah, a Senior Systems Administrator with a passion for all things PowerShell, fitness, and continuous learning. 
Currently calling Minneapolis, Minnesota my home, I thrive on crafting purposeful, meticulously designed, and automated solutions for both on-premises and cloud-based systems.

My professional journey often leads me to the realms of Azure, Intune, and Office 365, where I leverage my favorite tools: **PowerShell**, Power Automate, and Terraform/Bicep, to streamline operations and enhance productivity.

Beyond the confines of the workplace and the world of scripting, you'll often find me immersed in the great outdoors, whether it's pounding the pavement running, exploring urban trails on my bike, scaling rock faces, trekking through nature, lounging in a hammock with a good book, or gliding across lakes and oceans on a paddleboard. 
And yes, I've been known to blend two of these activities together!  

## Blogging Journey  
The genesis of this blog traces back to a pivotal moment: solving a particularly aggravating technical challenge with a server thanks to insights gleaned from an IT legend online.

Inspired by the generosity of the online community and fueled by a desire to pay it forward, I embarked on this blogging journey as a means to contribute and share knowledge with fellow enthusiasts. 
While my posts span various topics, the common threads are technology insights and glimpses into my life as a Systems Engineer.  
 
Here, you won't find rigid categorizations, thematic constraints, or standardized formats. Instead, expect a mix of musings and reflections on technology intertwined with personal anecdotes and experiences from my life.  

Thank you for dropping by. Your visit is truly appreciated!
